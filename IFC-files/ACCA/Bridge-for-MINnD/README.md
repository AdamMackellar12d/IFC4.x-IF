# Bridge example by ACCA for MINnD

This is a Bridge model created for the **MINnD** project by **ACCA software**.

It uses the new IFC4X3 standard features (i.e. new spatial structure, alignments, linear placements, sweeps along the alignment, referents, etc.) in order to create a generic two-way bridge model with the use of the new standard.

The level of detail is fit for maintenance purposes, and the bridge is generic enough to represent 80% of the existing common bridges (also known as "horse bridges").
