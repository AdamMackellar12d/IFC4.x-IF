# IFC alignment examples

This folder contains a set of atomic test files that covers all different types of alignment segments.

- **IFC-files-NoGeometry**: contains IFC examples where alignment is defined only in its business-logic part (without geometry);
- **IFC-files-WithGeneratedGeometry**: takes the previous IFC examples and add the geometry part to them - using RDF tool.

:warning: Although the IFC version code in the header is `IFC4X3`, these files are compliant to the latest 4.3 schema (IFC4X3_ADD1)
