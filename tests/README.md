# Tests

## How the tests are structured
Each test is structured as follows:

0. **Test title and metadata** (test code, author, dataset source, etc.)
1. **Intent**, a summary of the test. It includes:
   - A list of main IFC concept templates involved in the test
2. **Prerequisites**, a list of test that shall be passed before taking this test
3. **Test dataset (input)**, a list of files supporting the test. May include a **Reference IFC file**
4. **Validation criteria**, all the criteria that are used to validate the success of the test. It includes:
   - **Formal rules**
     - **IFC standard (schema and specification)**
     - **Test case-specific checks**
   - **Informal criteria**
   - **Expected geometry**
   - **Control parameters**

üîç See the [Test template](./Test%20template.md) for details.

### Output of the test
Every test has a subfolder named **test-output**. Through a pull request, the party executing the test will upload in such subfolder:
   - n. 1 IFC file, named using this convention: `TestCode`_`SoftwareVendor`.`ifc` (Example: *STN01_AmazingSoft.ifc*)
   - where applicable, any other evidence of fulfillment of the informal validation criteria (e.g., screenshots)

‚ùó These output will be the base for the validation and verification of the results of the test case.
